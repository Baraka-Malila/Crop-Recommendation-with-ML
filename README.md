# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify the best crops to plant based on environmental factors and soil conditions. This system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various features and provide recommendations for optimal crop choices.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes historical crop data and environmental conditions to make predictions.
- **User Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input their data and receive recommendations.
- **Model Integration**: Integrates a pre-trained machine learning model for accurate recommendations.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main application script that handles user inputs and interacts with the machine learning model.
- `crops.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook used for developing and analyzing the crop recommendation model.
- `Crop_recommendation.csv`: Dataset containing information about various crops and environmental factors.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model used for making predictions.
- `static/`: Directory containing static assets such as images.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web interface.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Users provide data about their environmental conditions and soil properties.
2. **Model Prediction**: The application uses the machine learning model to analyze the input data.
3. **Recommendation**: The system outputs a list of recommended crops based on the analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Baraka-Malila/Crop-Recommendation-with-ML.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You may use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` if available.

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the Web Interface**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the application.
